<p>Hi guys!! My name is Danielle Jung and I will be junior next year at Lynbrook High School. I'm super happy to be a part of this program and am looking forward to all of the things we are going to learn.</p>
<p>With school, piano, and soccer, I don't have much free time, but when I do, I enjoy baking and cleaning because it relaxes me. I also really love reading. My current favorite author is Agatha Christie, and past ones incldue John Grisham and Michael Crichton. I don't enjoy horror movies or celery. </p>
<p> Fun facts about me: 
1. I'll choose sleep over food
2. I have unecessarily small pinky fingers 
3. My two sisters and I were all born in January and wear the same shoe size.
</p>
<p> I don't really have any "favorite" webpages besides the usual facebook, tumblr, etc. that I constantly switch through.</p></font>

<h1> CLASS PROJECTS: </h1>
<h2>Side Scrolling Game: Billy the Baby Blue Whale</h2>
<img src = "billyboy.jpeg" alt = "me!!" style = "width: 400px; height: 300px;" align = "middle";>
<p> Slide Scrolling Game!! I partnered with Lily on this one. The object of the game is to help Billy the Baby Blue Whale catch up to his mother while avoiding the trash and predators. The player uses the up and down arrow keys to navigate through the water. We used Scratch to create this project. </p> 
<br>
<img src = "billy.jpeg" alt = "me!!" style = "width: 400px; height: 300px;" align = "middle";>
<p> This is the code we used for Billy. There were more blocks with the same code, but for different variables. Essentially, this code says that when the green flag is clicked, Billy will give the "instructions" and the score will be reset to zero. If he touches an obstacle, in case the shark, he will say "I've been eaten!" and the score will show. Then, the player will be taken to the "high score!" page if they beat their high score, and then the "game over" page. </p>
<br>
<img src = "sand.jpeg" alt = "me!!" style = "width: 400px; height: 300px;" align = "middle";>
<p> This is the code for the sand. It uses cloning to repeatedly move across the screen to make it look like the back drop is moving.</p>
<br>
<img src = "shark.jpeg" alt = "me!!" style = "width: 450px; height: 300px;" align = "middle";>
<p> This is the code for the obstacles that come at Billy. They are coded to create clones of themselves that move across the screen, and then delete the previous clone so just one remains. This creates the illusion that the shark is moving across the screen. </p>

<h2>Shapes.py</h2>
<img src = "initialhex.jpeg" alt = "me!!" style = "width: 300px; height: 250px;" align = "middle";>
<img src = "hex.jpeg" alt = "me!!" style = "width: 300px; height: 275px;" align = "middle";>
<p>These are screenshots from my next project, "shapes". We used python turtle to create a program that drew shapes and colors according to our code.</p>
<br>
<img src = "hexcode.jpeg" alt = "me!!" style = "width: 300px; height: 300px;" align = "middle";>
<p> This is the code for my program. It's fairly short. It says that each time a line is drawn, the color should be a new and random one. Each line length and angle is determined by an small equation that is based on the number of sides wanted by the user.</p>

<h2> Obamafied! </h2>
<img src = "profilepic.jpeg" alt = "me!!" style = "width: 300px; height: 300px;" align = "middle";>
<img src = "obamapic.jpeg" alt = "me!!" style = "width: 300px; height: 300px;" align = "middle";>
<p>The first picture is before being plugged into my programm and the second is after being plugged in. We wrote code that "obamafied" a picture and basically converted certain pixels into different colors that were similar to Obama's 2012 "obamicon" posters. </p>
<br>
<img src = "obamacode.jpeg" alt = "me!!" style = "width: 500px; height: 400px;" align = "middle";>
<p> This is the code for the program that basically says that if a pixel is a certain color, it should be reassigned to another. </p>
